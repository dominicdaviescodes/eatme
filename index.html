        <h3>A new play on eating disorders</h3>
        <p>
          Having worked as a professional actress on stage and screen for some
          years, it has been a fascinating and challenging experience to both
          write and co-direct ‘Eat Me’. It was a natural progression really;
          having had a passion for creative writing since childhood, and also
          having suffered myself from anorexia, I had an urge to put pen to
          paper, with the chief aim of helping others to gain an understanding
          of the way this illness takes control of a sufferer’s mind, body and
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything that happens in the play to either Libby, Kate or
          Jonathan, happened to me or to someone I know. These stories are
          real.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with Sally McCormack, who has written a play on
          schizophrenia and early psychosis in which I performed, has been a
          privilege, and together we hope to take both these stories further,
          in order to increase knowledge and understanding of mental health
          issues through the medium of drama. It has been a joy to work with
          this amazing cast and I thank them for their hard work and
          dedication throughout.”
        </p>

          ‘Eat Me’ has recently been published by Bramley Books. Copies are
          available for purchase.

          <p>Eat Me is a play about anorexia written by one of the actors Suzanna Walters, based on her own experience
            of the condition. She plays anorexia itself, playing on the minds of the other actors, effectively playing
            young people tormented for various reasons by this anorexia. This unusual device works well and provides an
            interesting insight into this dangerous and little understood or reported illness.</p>

          <p>Four talented actors bring hope for recovery and also clarity in trying to understand the pain, suffering
            and relentless manipulation that the ‘voice of anorexia’ brings to those it affects. The play is, at times,
            harrowing but positive. Well done and thank you for tackling a difficult subject with such honesty and
            sensitivity.</p>
